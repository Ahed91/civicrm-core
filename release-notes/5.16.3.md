## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

- **_Custom Fields_: When viewing a contacts custom fields of type file. A fatal error can occur if the files don't have a description
  ([dev/core#1186](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1186): [#15055](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15055))**
- **_Case Custom Fields_: When trying to merge contacts that have cases with custom data a fatal error is generated
  ([dev/core#1183](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1183): [#15084](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15084))**
- **_Upgrade_: When end users try to upgrade from versions prior to 5.16.0 to 5.16 and the PHP version being used is 5.x a fatal error is encounted
  because of code that cannot execute under PHP5.x. Now there will be an early notice return indicating they need a higher PHP version
  ([dev/drupal#79](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/drupal/issues/79): [#15090](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15090),
  [Backdrop#100](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-backdrop/pull/100), [drupal#584](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/pull/584]),
  [WordPress#162](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/pull/162))**
- **_Contributions_: When editing a contribution data can be lost because the Additional Information and Premium sections were not being properly populated
  ([dev/financial#66](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/issues/66): [#15108](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15108))**
